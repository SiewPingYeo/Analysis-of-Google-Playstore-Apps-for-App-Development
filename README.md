# Analysis-of-Google-Playstore-Apps-for-App-Development
This is an analysis of 2.3 million apps on Google Playstore. The analysis results are essential for an app developer looking to develop a potentially successful app. 
It looks into the various features of a successful app ( more than 1 million installs and rating 4.0 to 5.0) and explore the 
optimal business model of an app based on user behaviour through ratings and install numbers. This allows an app developer to understand the google playstore market and 
set the nature and direction of the app that he/she might want to build.  

The dataset used in this analysis is obtained through Kaggle , contributed by author Gautham Prakash. (https://www.kaggle.com/gauthamp10/google-playstore-apps) The raw dataset consists of 24 columns and 2.3 million rows, obtained through web-scraping and accurate as of June 2021.

There are many interesting columns that we can explore in the dataset, such as the App Size, Installs, Privacy Policy and App Price. However, for the purpose of this analysis, we will refer to mainly two columns as the metrics to measure an application's success - Rating and Installs/Minimum Installs. In this analysis, a successful application is defined to have high ratings (4.0 - 5.0) and high installation numbers( > 1 million installs).

**The goals to be addressed are:**

**1. How do the features of an application affect its success?**

a) What are the top app categories in the market?

b) How do the ratings and install numbers differ between the application categories? 

c) How does the application price influence the application rating and installation numbers? 

d) How does the application size influence the application rating and installation numbers?

e) What is the optimal minimal android system supported for an application to achieve high ratings and high installation numbers?

f) Would a well-maintained application achieve higher ratings and installation numbers?

g) What is the most popular content rating for successful applications? 

h) Does having a privacy policy enhances the success of an application? 

i) How does being listed as an Editor's Choice affect the success of an applications? 

j) Are there applications with high installs and yet low ratings , translating to possible user disappointment?

**2. What is an optimal business model of a successful application?**

 a) Are successful applications usually free or paid ? 

 b) How do ad-supported applications and applications with in-app purchases differ in terms of ratings and installation numbers?
 
 
**The flow of this analysis is as follow:**

1. Basic data exploration and preparation
2. Data cleaning and data wrangling
3. Univariate exploration
4. Bi-variate and multi-variate exploration to address our goals
5. Recommendation for App Development

## Lessons Learned

I have learned a lot about data cleaning, wrangling and data visualisation from this project. It has exposed me to the rigour of critical thinking during the EDA needed for the analysis. 
These skills will be useful in future EDA and machine learning projects which I am looking forward to embark on.
