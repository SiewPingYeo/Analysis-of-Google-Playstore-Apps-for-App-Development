# Analysis-of-Google-Playstore-Apps-for-App-Development
This is an analysis of 2.3 million apps on Google Playstore. The analysis results are essential for an app developer looking to develop a potentially successful app. 
It looks into the various features of a successful app ( more than 1 million installs and rating 4.0 to 5.0) and explore the 
optimal business model of an app based on user behaviour through ratings and install numbers. This allows an app developer to understand the google playstore market and 
set the nature and direction of the app that he/she might want to build.

## Lessons Learned

I have learned a lot about data cleaning, wrangling and data visualisation from this project. It has exposed me to the rigour of critical thinking during the EDA needed for the analysis. 
These skills will be useful in future EDA and machine learning projects which I am looking forward to embark on.
